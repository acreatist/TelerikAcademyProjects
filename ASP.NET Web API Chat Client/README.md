A Knockout.js MVVM based simple web chat client
======================

This is a team project, build for Telerik Academy's .net Web API course.

In a team of 4 members, my role was to create the web front-end and ui of a chat application, consuming REST services, build 
on top of ASP.NET Web API application.

At a glance, the chat application should support user registration and login. The Chat is based on user created chatrooms, 
where a logged user can post messages.

The framework chosen is Knockout.js - an MVVM JS Framework. 

Key moments:
* A separate data layer, holding the data retrieval logic, based on AJAX Calls. 
* A separate views layer, loading partial html files into the main UI layout.
* A separate viewmodels layer, holding the main viewmodels, used for the KO MVVM logic.
